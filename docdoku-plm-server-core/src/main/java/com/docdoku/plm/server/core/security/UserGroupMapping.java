/**
 * Useful class for managing security group as used by application servers.
 * This class has nothing to do with {@link UserGroup} and the context-aware security
 * model where a user may be granted full access on a given object and not be allowed
 * to see another one. This class just defines static groups which will lead to one of
 * the 3 global roles supported by the application: "users", "admin" and "guest".
 *
 * All regular users belong to, and only to, the "users" group.
 * "admin" is for the superuser account who can perform administration tasks.
 * "guest" role is for non logged users who access items that have been published.
